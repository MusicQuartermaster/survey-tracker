I.	HOW TO INSTALL (Windows)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Download the "Survey Tracker.zip" file
2) Move the folder to wherever you want it to be stored (for example, I keep the folder on my Desktop)
3) Right click the zip file and click "Extract Here"
	--This will create a folder called Survey Tracker with several files inside.
4) (OPTIONAL) Right click the file "Survey Tracker.exe", hover over Send To, and click Desktop (Create Shortcut)
	--This will add a shortcut to your desktop so you can open the program more easily

You should now be able to run "Survey Tracker.exe" either from the shortcut you created or from the original file

Please note that your antivirus software will most likely flag the program as being a potential security threat.
This is because I didn't want to pay over $400 to have the software officially certified, signed, and licensed to
avoid this.
Trust me when I say it's not a virus.

II.	QUICK-START GUIDE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Launch the program "Survey Tracker.exe".
You will see a small window with a few buttons at the top, most are grayed out.
To begin, add a new student by clicking the Add button.
Answer each of the prompts that it asks (the student's name followed by the date you last gave them a survey).
	If you gave them a survey today, you can leave the text box empty and click OK.
	The date format is MM/DD/YYYY, but it also allows you to type "21" in place of "2021" if you so desire.
	0's are not required in front of the month or day. For example, for March 8th, you can simply type 3/8/21.
Make sure to click the Save button once you make any changes.
You should now see that student's name appear in the appear in the window.
	By selecting the student's name, the other buttons will activate.

III.	ABOUT THE SOFTWARE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main function of the Survey Tracker is to keep track of when you should give your recurring appointments their
monthly survey.
Clicking on a student's name activates the rest of the functionality of the software.
The following buttons and their functions are listed here, the * denoting functions that require you select a
student first:

Save			Saves any changes you've made to a file in the source folder.
Add 			Allows you to add students to your list.
Remove*			Allows you to remove a student from the list.
Give Survey* 		Sets today as the last day you gave the selected student a survey.
View Last Survey*	Displays the date of the last time a survey was given.
Set Last Survey*	Allows you to change the last time a survey was given.

I set the software to cycle based on a 4-week cycle rather than one based on the number of days in the month.
	Ultimately, this means you might administer a survey twice in a single month, but better more surveys than
	fewer.
	I chose 27 days instead of 28 to allow the program to notify you a day in advance of what students have a
	survey due so you can prepare accordingly without scrambling in the last 5 minutes of your appointment.
I chose not to include an auto-save feature in case you accidentally click the "Give Survey" button on accident,
so you can just close and reopen the program to undo it.

Currently, the software allows you to add multiple students with the same name. I would recommend at the very
least including the student's last initial. Personally, I include the full name since no one has access to my PC
so I can avoid violating FERPA. You can also use the student's netID if you're so inclined.

IV.	FEEDBACK AND BUG REPORTING
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the off chance you encounter a situation where the program runs into an error while saving (the
program will notify you if such an event occurs), then immediately exit the program. Your most recently saved
data is stored in the file "backup.data", which you can copy and paste into the "save.data" file. If you do
encounter this error, please also email me (nhout2@uis.edu) the "error.log" file so I can diagnose and fix the
problem ASAP.

If you have any suggestions or complaints about the software, you can also email these to me (again,
nhout2@uis.edu), and I will do my best to make the user experience as seemless as possible.
